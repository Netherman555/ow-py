# ow-py
A python library that allows you to retrieve player data and information from the OvrStat (https://github.com/s32x/ovrstat) API.

Currently, the library allows you to receive data based on a character level, as well as some basic profile data (level, icon, etc.)

# Requirements

Currently the project does not require any special modules that are not included with base python, but for the sake of being organized:

 - JSON: Basic python JavaScript Object Notation library.
 - Requests: Basic python library that allows for HTTP requests.
 
 # How to Contribute
 
 I get it.  This code is definitely not the most beautiful code on Earth, mostly because I'm a high school student.  If you want
 to contribute, polish it up, fix documentation, feel free to do so, and I'll review it as often as I can.
 
 If you'd like to add extra features to a branch please let me know so that I can help with the development of said features in any way 
 that I can.
